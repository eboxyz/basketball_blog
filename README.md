	Basketballog Project
		Intro
			For this project, I had a basketball blog theme in mind. To begin with, I wanted tags and searchability 
			availability within the posts. I had a pretty high end goal in mind, and I believe that I was able to conduct most
			basic features that I wanted. My most basic of demands was the ability to view embedded youtube videos from the index
			page, and have commenting be available on the posts. 
		
		Technology Used
			I used a number of gems within this project, and I spent a decent amount of time researching what I needed to use, 
			what was available, and how well received these gems were. 
			
			Bootstrap-Sass
				Bootstrap-sass is so great for someone like me who isn't very css-minded, but UX is a huge part of how an app is
				received, so I believe that bootstrap is a necessity for me. 
			
			Bootstrap-modal-rails
				This gem wasn't anything spectacular for my uses, but for a page that relies on the usage of multiple modals, this 
				would be a timesaver.

			Rails_12factor
				This was a gem that I believed was required by Heroku, and so I installed it when I had some deploying problems. 
				This helps to serve assets in production.

			Bcrypt
				This gem is a huge help in storing passwords, it encrypts passwords in a seemingly random text string.

			Thumbs UP
				I wanted to use this gem for upvote management and sortability, but I didn't get to reach that point of my project

	Problems
		Problems I ran into were, getting sick in the middle of project week, and skipping essentially two days of work time. I spent a lot of time working on learning how to properly migrate and manipulate database communication. Also, a huge part is how structured ruby is, and how strict the requirements are for something. 

		I solved all the problems that I had set with the time available, but I wish I could've added a few more features.
